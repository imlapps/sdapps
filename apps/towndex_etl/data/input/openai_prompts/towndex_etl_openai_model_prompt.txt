A town board's meeting minutes has been attached.

Please identify and extract all entities and relationships from the document and return valid Schema.org JSON-LD.

Below are some constraints for how you should create the graph.

Preserve the following structure. An "Event" is the root of the graph, and all subsections are "Event" types that are the main Event's "subevent".

Subsections include but are not limited to: BUSINESS MEETING, MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING, REPORTS, RESOLUTIONS, CORRESPONDENCE, OLD BUSINESS, NEW BUSINESS, WARRANTS, VISITORS WHO WISH TO SPEAK, ADJOURNMENT.

Extract all information under all the subsections.

Use "MonetaryAmount" instead of a "FinancialProduct" type.

This is a town board meeting, so the town supervisor and councilmembers must be involved in all VoteActions. List them under the "participant" property.

Information under the "Reports" section must be classified under the "Report" type.

Each "Report" must have a corresponding "VoteAction".

Information under the "Resolutions" subsection must be classified under the "VoteAction" type.

Information under the "Warrants" section must have a "VoteAction" type.

If there is any financial information under warrants, create an "Invoice" type and add individual fund expenses to the "referencesOrder" property.

Below are constraints for how to use some Schema.org types and properties.

For all types, the properties "description" and "name" are required.

For type "Event", the property "about" is required.

For type "Message", the property "sender" is required.

For type "MonetaryAmount", the property "value" is required.

For type "QuantitativeValue", the properties "unitText" and "value" are required.

For type "VoteAction", the property "agent" is required.

Please do not invent any types of properties.
